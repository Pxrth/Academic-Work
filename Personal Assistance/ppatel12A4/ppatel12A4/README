How to compile/run

Once you are in the source folder in the terminal, simple type in "make" and 
the program will compile successfully. Then type in "./bin/program assets/<dictionary filename>"
(assuming all dictionary files are in assets) all the keywords and sentences will be added to the tree
and then you will be introduced to the user interface menu. You can teach Eliza a new rule (Option 1), 
make Eliza forget a rule (Option 2),see all the rules (Option 3) modify a rule (Option 4), and finally
have a conversation with Eliza using (Option 5) 


Limitations

If the file doesn't exist or the input for filename is incorrect the program exits
The file doesn't have enough rules so the conversation with the AI would be short
