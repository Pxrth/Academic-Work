How to compile/run

Once you are in the source folder in the terminal, simple type in "make" and 
the program will compile successfully. Then type in "./bin/program assets/<dictionary filename>"
(assuming all dictionary files are in assets) all the words will be added to the hash table and 
then you will be introduced to the user interface menu. You can add to the table (option 1), 
remove from the table (option 2),see entire table (option 4) and spell check a file (option 3), to
run the spell check function you must type in "assets/<filename>". 


Hash Function and Collision Resolution Strategy  

For the hash function, to determine a key for each word I took the ascii number of the character
and then mulitpled it by (i + 1) for every iteration for the length of the word. 

For the collision issue, I created a table with 26 index and took the key of every word and mod it
by 26, once i found the index I created a linked list at the index and stored all the words with 
the same index.



Limitations

If the file doesn't exist or the input for filename is incorrect the program exits
